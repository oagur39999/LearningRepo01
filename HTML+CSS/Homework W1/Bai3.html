    <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may <i>look</i> happy, but
        he's a <i>little</i> disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.</p>

    <ul>Jack would really like...
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li>Magic tricks</li>
        <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
        <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a
            href="http://www.toysrus.com/">ToysRUs</a> and <a href="http://www.etoys.com/">eToys</a>.</p>
